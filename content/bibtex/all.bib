@inproceedings{Buchholz2022reconstruction,
 abstract = {Location trajectories collected by smartphones and other devices represent a valuable data source for applications such as location-based services. Likewise, trajectories have the potential to reveal sensitive information about individuals, e.g., religious beliefs or sexual orientations. Accordingly, trajectory datasets require appropriate sanitization.  Due to their strong theoretical privacy guarantees, differential private publication mechanisms receive much attention.  However, the large amount of noise required to achieve differential privacy yields structural differences, e.g., ship trajectories passing over land. We propose a deep learning-based Reconstruction Attack on Protected Trajectories (RAoPT), that leverages the mentioned differences to partly reconstruct the original trajectory from a differential private release. The evaluation shows that our RAoPT model can reduce the Euclidean and Hausdorff distances between the released and original trajectories by over 68% on two real-world datasets under protection with ɛ ≤ 1. In this setting, the attack increases the average Jaccard index of the trajectories' convex hulls, representing a user's activity space, by over 180%. Trained on the GeoLife dataset, the model still reduces the Euclidean and Hausdorff distances by over 60% for T-Drive trajectories protected with a state-of-the-art mechanism (ɛ = 0.1). This work highlights shortcomings of current trajectory publication mechanisms, and thus motivates further research on privacy-preserving publication schemes.},

 abstract = {While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models. (2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN - affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees. In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained use cases.},

<jats:p>Semantic understanding of roadways is a key enabling factor for safe autonomous driving. However, existing autonomous driving datasets provide well-structured urban roads while ignoring unstructured roadways containing distress, potholes, water puddles, and various kinds of road patches i.e., earthen, gravel etc. To this end, we introduce Road Region Segmentation dataset (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>S100K)—a large-scale dataset and benchmark for training and evaluation of road segmentation in aforementioned challenging unstructured roadways. R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>S100K comprises 100K images extracted from a large and diverse set of video sequences covering more than 1000 km of roadways. Out of these 100K privacy respecting images, 14,000 images have fine pixel-labeling of road regions, with 86,000 unlabeled images that can be leveraged through semi-supervised learning methods. Alongside, we present an Efficient Data Sampling based self-training framework to improve learning by leveraging unlabeled data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves learning methods in generalizability and reduces the labeling cost for semantic segmentation tasks. Our benchmark will be publicly available to facilitate future research at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://r2s100k.github.io/" ext-link-type="uri">https://r2s100k.github.io/</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>},

 abstract = {<jats:p>Digital identity is evolving from centralized systems to a decentralized approach known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). SSI empowers individuals to control their digital identities, eliminating reliance on third-party data custodians and reducing the risk of data breaches. However, the concept of trust in SSI remains complex and fragmented. This paper systematically analyzes trust in SSI in light of its components and threats posed by various actors in the system. As a result, we derive three distinct trust models that capture the threats and mitigations identified across SSI literature and implementations. Our work provides a foundational framework for future SSI research and development, including a comprehensive catalogue of SSI components and design requirements for trust, shortcomings in existing SSI systems and areas for further exploration.</jats:p>},

@phdthesis{Krul2024trust,
 abstract = {The digital revolution has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, and identity is no exception. Though ever present, it is now time to seriously and carefully consider the digitisation of identity. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has emerged as a promising solution, empowering individuals to control their own identity data and reducing reliance on centralised systems. SSI is a user-centric approach to digital identity. Its intrinsic focus on credentials makes it well-suited to model existing traditional physical identity credentials. SSI eliminates reliance on third-party data custodians, reduces the risk of data breaches and maintains the privacy of its users. However, the concept of trust in SSI remains complex and fragmented. Furthermore, there is an unaddressed inherent tension between balancing the need to safeguard user privacy (by keeping identifiable information protected) and the need to establish trust between untrusting parties. This thesis provides two significant and novel contributions towards defining and establishing trust and privacy in SSI. First, this thesis systematically analyses trust in SSI in light of its components and threats posed by various actors in the system. Three distinct trust models are derived, capturing the threats and mitigation strategies found in SSI literature and implementations. This work provides a foundational framework for future SSI research and development, including a comprehensive catalogue of SSI components and design requirements for trust, shortcomings in existing SSI systems, and areas for further exploration. Second, this thesis explores identity escrow as a potential solution to the privacy-trust conflict in SSI. By placing private identity data in escrow accessible only under specific conditions, identity escrow offers a potential compromise for untrusting parties. This thesis proposes a practical design and implementation of identity escrow in SSI as a novel extension to existing schemes. This extension is evaluated for the overhead it introduces on SSI implementations, and the design is compared to existing non-SSI escrow approaches. Together, these contributions aim to establish a future where our digital identity can foster trust between untrusting parties while preserving user privacy.},

 abstract = {Distributed anonymity services, such as onion routing networks or cryptocurrency tumblers, promise privacy protection without trusted third parties. While the security of these services is often well-researched, security implications of their required bootstrapping processes are usually neglected: Users either jointly conduct the anonymization themselves or they need to rely on a set of non-colluding privacy peers. However, the typically small number of privacy peers enable single adversaries to mimic distributed services. We thus present AnonBoot, a Sybil-resistant medium to securely bootstrap distributed anonymity services via public blockchains. AnonBoot enforces that peers periodically create a small proof of work to refresh their eligibility of providing secure anonymity services. A pseudo-random, locally replicable bootstrapping process using on-chain entropy then prevents biasing the election of eligible peers. Our evaluation using Bitcoin as AnonBoot’s underlying blockchain shows its feasibility to maintain a trustworthy repository of 1000 peers with only a small storage footprint while supporting arbitrarily large user bases on top of most blockchains.},

@inproceedings{Pennekamp2020privacy,
 abstract = {Nowadays, collaborations between industrial companies always go hand in hand with trust issues, i.e., exchanging valuable production data entails the risk of improper use of potentially sensitive information. Therefore, companies hesitate to offer their production data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other companies to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data exchanges, and the utilization of external knowledge are significant. In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based Parameter Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process parameters privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability of our platform based on two distinct real-world use cases: injection molding and machine tools. We show that BPE is both scalable and deployable for different needs to foster industrial collaborations. Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.},

 abstract = {Following the recent Internet of Things-induced trends on digitization in general, industrial applications will further evolve as well. With a focus on the domains of manufacturing and production, the Internet of Production pursues the vision of a digitized, globally interconnected, yet secure environment by establishing a distributed knowledge base. Background. As part of our collaborative research of advancing the scope of industrial applications through cybersecurity and privacy, we identified a set of common challenges and pitfalls that surface in such applied interdisciplinary collaborations. Aim. Our goal with this paper is to support researchers in the emerging field of cybersecurity in industrial settings by formalizing our experiences as reference for other research efforts, in industry and academia alike. Method. Based on our experience, we derived a process cycle of performing such interdisciplinary research, from the initial idea to the eventual dissemination and paper writing. This presented methodology strives to successfully bootstrap further research and to encourage further work in this emerging area. Results. Apart from our newly proposed process cycle, we report on our experiences and conduct a case study applying this methodology, raising awareness for challenges in cybersecurity research for industrial applications. We further detail the interplay between our process cycle and the data lifecycle in applied research data management. Finally, we augment our discussion with an industrial as well as an academic view on this research area and highlight that both areas still have to overcome significant challenges to sustainably and securely advance industrial applications. Conclusions. With our proposed process cycle for interdisciplinary research in the intersection of cybersecurity and industrial application, we provide a foundation for further research. We look forward to promising research initiatives, projects, and directions that emerge based on our methodological work.},

 abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
<jats:p>Over the past few years, surgical data science has attracted substantial interest from the machine learning (ML) community. Various studies have demonstrated the efficacy of emerging ML techniques in analysing surgical data, particularly recordings of procedures, for digitising clinical and non-clinical functions like preoperative planning, context-aware decision-making, and operating skill assessment. However, this field is still in its infancy and lacks representative, well-annotated datasets for training robust models in intermediate ML tasks. Also, existing datasets suffer from inaccurate labels, hindering the development of reliable models. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing robust models for surgical tool classification using noisy endoscopic videos. Our methodology introduces two key innovations: (1) an intelligent active learning strategy for minimal dataset identification and label correction by human experts through collective intelligence; and (2) an assembling strategy for a student-teacher model-based self-training framework to achieve the robust classification of 14 surgical tools in a semi-supervised fashion. Furthermore, we employ strategies such as weighted data loaders and label smoothing to enable the models to learn difficult samples and address class imbalance issues. The proposed methodology achieves an average F1-score of 85.88% for the ensemble model-based self-training with class weights, and 80.88% without class weights for noisy tool labels. Also, our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, which effectively demonstrates its effectiveness.</jats:p>},

@misc{Unknown2020consequences,
 abstract = {A well-known conjecture of Orlov asks whether the existence of a full exceptional collection implies rationality of the underlying variety. We prove this conjecture for arithmetic toric varieties over general fields. We also investigate a slight generalization of this conjecture, where the endomorphism algebras of the exceptional objects are allowed to be separable field extensions of the base field. We show this generalization is false by exhibiting a smooth, projective threefold over the the field of rational numbers that possesses a full etale-exceptional collection but not a rational point. The counterexample comes from twisting a non-retract rational variety with a rational point and full etale-exceptional collection by a torsor that is invisible to Brauer invariants. Along the way, we develop some tools for linearizing objects, including a group that controls linearizations.},

@misc{Unknown2020separable,
 abstract = {Over a non-closed field, it is a common strategy to use separable algebras as invariants to distinguish algebraic and geometric objects. The most famous example is the deep connection between Severi-Brauer varieties and central simple algebras. For more general varieties, one might use endomorphism algebras of line bundles, of indecomposable vector bundles, or of exceptional objects in their derived categories. Using Galois cohomology, we describe a new invariant of reductive algebraic groups that captures precisely when this strategy will fail. Our main result characterizes this invariant in terms of coflasque resolutions of linear algebraic groups introduced by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene. We determine whether or not this invariant is trivial for many fields. For number fields, we show it agrees with the Tate-Shafarevich group of the linear algebraic group, up to behavior at real places.},
