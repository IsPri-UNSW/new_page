<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
<jats:p>Consumer electronics or daily use home appliances are the basic necessity of every household. With the adoption of IoT in consumer electronics, this industry is set to rise exponentially. In recent times, the demand for consumer electronics rises amidst the pandemic due to a paradigm shift from in-office culture to work from home. Despite intelligent IoT devices, smart home configuration, and appliances at our disposal, the rudimentary client-server architecture fails to provide facilities like full access control of data and devices, transparency, secured communication, and synchronization between multiple devices, etc. to the users.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
<jats:p>To overcome these limitations, Blockchain technology has been adopted in recent years, however, it has its own set of limitations in its widespread implementation. Hence, we propose a methodology using the IOTA platform, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) for secured communication between consumer electronics devices and appliances.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
<jats:p>The implementation provides access control, interoperability, data storage, and management with an exploratory insight towards a decentralized micro-payment use-case between Electric cars and charging stations.</jats:p>
