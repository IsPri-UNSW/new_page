          <jats:p>Semantic understanding of roadways is a key enabling factor for safe autonomous driving. However, existing autonomous driving datasets provide well-structured urban roads while ignoring unstructured roadways containing distress, potholes, water puddles, and various kinds of road patches i.e., earthen, gravel etc. To this end, we introduce Road Region Segmentation dataset (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>S100K)—a large-scale dataset and benchmark for training and evaluation of road segmentation in aforementioned challenging unstructured roadways. R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>S100K comprises 100K images extracted from a large and diverse set of video sequences covering more than 1000 km of roadways. Out of these 100K privacy respecting images, 14,000 images have fine pixel-labeling of road regions, with 86,000 unlabeled images that can be leveraged through semi-supervised learning methods. Alongside, we present an Efficient Data Sampling based self-training framework to improve learning by leveraging unlabeled data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves learning methods in generalizability and reduces the labeling cost for semantic segmentation tasks. Our benchmark will be publicly available to facilitate future research at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://r2s100k.github.io/" ext-link-type="uri">https://r2s100k.github.io/</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>},

          <jats:p>Over the past few years, surgical data science has attracted substantial interest from the machine learning (ML) community. Various studies have demonstrated the efficacy of emerging ML techniques in analysing surgical data, particularly recordings of procedures, for digitising clinical and non-clinical functions like preoperative planning, context-aware decision-making, and operating skill assessment. However, this field is still in its infancy and lacks representative, well-annotated datasets for training robust models in intermediate ML tasks. Also, existing datasets suffer from inaccurate labels, hindering the development of reliable models. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing robust models for surgical tool classification using noisy endoscopic videos. Our methodology introduces two key innovations: (1) an intelligent active learning strategy for minimal dataset identification and label correction by human experts through collective intelligence; and (2) an assembling strategy for a student-teacher model-based self-training framework to achieve the robust classification of 14 surgical tools in a semi-supervised fashion. Furthermore, we employ strategies such as weighted data loaders and label smoothing to enable the models to learn difficult samples and address class imbalance issues. The proposed methodology achieves an average F1-score of 85.88% for the ensemble model-based self-training with class weights, and 80.88% without class weights for noisy tool labels. Also, our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, which effectively demonstrates its effectiveness.</jats:p>},
