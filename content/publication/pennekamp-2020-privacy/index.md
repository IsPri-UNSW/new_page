abstract: 'Nowadays, collaborations between industrial companies always go hand in
  hand with trust issues, i.e., exchanging valuable production data entails the risk
  of improper use of potentially sensitive information. Therefore, companies hesitate
  to offer their production data, e.g., process parameters that would allow other
  companies to establish new production lines faster, against a quid pro quo. Nevertheless,
  the expected benefits of industrial collaboration, data exchanges, and the utilization
  of external knowledge are significant. In this paper, we introduce our Bloom filter-based
  Parameter Exchange (BPE), which enables companies to exchange process parameters
  privacy-preservingly. We demonstrate the applicability of our platform based on
  two distinct real-world use cases: injection molding and machine tools. We show
  that BPE is both scalable and deployable for different needs to foster industrial
  collaborations. Thereby, we reward data-providing companies with payments while
  preserving their valuable data and reducing the risks of data leakage.'
