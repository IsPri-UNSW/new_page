abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Semantic understanding of roadways
  is a key enabling factor for safe autonomous driving. However, existing autonomous
  driving datasets provide well-structured urban roads while ignoring unstructured
  roadways containing distress, potholes, water puddles, and various kinds of road
  patches i.e., earthen, gravel etc. To this end, we introduce Road Region Segmentation
  dataset (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>S100K)—a large-scale dataset and benchmark for training
  and evaluation of road segmentation in aforementioned challenging unstructured roadways.
  R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>S100K comprises 100K images extracted from a large and diverse
  set of video sequences covering more than 1000 km of roadways. Out of these 100K
  privacy respecting images, 14,000 images have fine pixel-labeling of road regions,
  with 86,000 unlabeled images that can be leveraged through semi-supervised learning
  methods. Alongside, we present an Efficient Data Sampling based self-training framework
  to improve learning by leveraging unlabeled data. Our experimental results demonstrate
  that the proposed method significantly improves learning methods in generalizability
  and reduces the labeling cost for semantic segmentation tasks. Our benchmark will
  be publicly available to facilitate future research at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"
