abstract: <h4>Introduction and importance</h4>Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) is a life-threatening,
  rapidly progressive infection of the skin and underlying soft tissues. Bacterial
  pathogens induce a toxic-shock reaction that reduces vascular flow, causing thrombosis,
  sepsis, and tissue necrosis. Treatment consists of immediate IV antibiotics and
  oftentimes surgical intervention. We present a case of acute NF that was misdiagnosed
  as cellulitis.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 17-year-old male was transferred to an
  emergency department from a rural hospital for further management of right lower
  extremity cellulitis and suspected sepsis. On examination, there was an ulcerated
  lesion on his right lower leg. Within 4 h, the patient underwent fasciotomy and
  debridement. The patient was hospitalized for 10 days, received a 3-week-course
  of Cefazolin, and underwent a meshed split-thickness skin graft. By the end of his
  hospital stay, he showed significant clinical improvement.<h4>Clinical discussion</h4>Misdiagnosis
  of NF will almost always lead to a poorer prognosis. The Laboratory Risk Indicator
  for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score is used to differentiate NF from other
  soft tissue infections. Yet, other diagnostic clues such as presentation or pain
  out of proportion to physical findings may be more relevant clinical indicators
  for a NF diagnosis. Moreover, though imaging findings of NF may be relevant, surgical
  fascial examination must not be delayed for the purpose of imaging. It is also important
  to note that cellulitis and NF do share a disease spectrum.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A
  life-threatening NF infection may seem to be a benign-appearing case of cellulitis,
  and thus early detection is vital.
