 abstract = {<h4>Introduction and importance</h4>Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) is a life-threatening, rapidly progressive infection of the skin and underlying soft tissues. Bacterial pathogens induce a toxic-shock reaction that reduces vascular flow, causing thrombosis, sepsis, and tissue necrosis. Treatment consists of immediate IV antibiotics and oftentimes surgical intervention. We present a case of acute NF that was misdiagnosed as cellulitis.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 17-year-old male was transferred to an emergency department from a rural hospital for further management of right lower extremity cellulitis and suspected sepsis. On examination, there was an ulcerated lesion on his right lower leg. Within 4 h, the patient underwent fasciotomy and debridement. The patient was hospitalized for 10 days, received a 3-week-course of Cefazolin, and underwent a meshed split-thickness skin graft. By the end of his hospital stay, he showed significant clinical improvement.<h4>Clinical discussion</h4>Misdiagnosis of NF will almost always lead to a poorer prognosis. The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score is used to differentiate NF from other soft tissue infections. Yet, other diagnostic clues such as presentation or pain out of proportion to physical findings may be more relevant clinical indicators for a NF diagnosis. Moreover, though imaging findings of NF may be relevant, surgical fascial examination must not be delayed for the purpose of imaging. It is also important to note that cellulitis and NF do share a disease spectrum.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A life-threatening NF infection may seem to be a benign-appearing case of cellulitis, and thus early detection is vital.},
