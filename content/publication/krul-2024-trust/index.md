abstract: The digital revolution has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives,
  and identity is no exception. Though ever present, it is now time to seriously and
  carefully consider the digitisation of identity. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has
  emerged as a promising solution, empowering individuals to control their own identity
  data and reducing reliance on centralised systems. SSI is a user-centric approach
  to digital identity. Its intrinsic focus on credentials makes it well-suited to
  model existing traditional physical identity credentials. SSI eliminates reliance
  on third-party data custodians, reduces the risk of data breaches and maintains
  the privacy of its users. However, the concept of trust in SSI remains complex and
  fragmented. Furthermore, there is an unaddressed inherent tension between balancing
  the need to safeguard user privacy (by keeping identifiable information protected)
  and the need to establish trust between untrusting parties. This thesis provides
  two significant and novel contributions towards defining and establishing trust
  and privacy in SSI. First, this thesis systematically analyses trust in SSI in light
  of its components and threats posed by various actors in the system. Three distinct
  trust models are derived, capturing the threats and mitigation strategies found
  in SSI literature and implementations. This work provides a foundational framework
  for future SSI research and development, including a comprehensive catalogue of
  SSI components and design requirements for trust, shortcomings in existing SSI systems,
  and areas for further exploration. Second, this thesis explores identity escrow
  as a potential solution to the privacy-trust conflict in SSI. By placing private
  identity data in escrow accessible only under specific conditions, identity escrow
  offers a potential compromise for untrusting parties. This thesis proposes a practical
  design and implementation of identity escrow in SSI as a novel extension to existing
  schemes. This extension is evaluated for the overhead it introduces on SSI implementations,
  and the design is compared to existing non-SSI escrow approaches. Together, these
  contributions aim to establish a future where our digital identity can foster trust
  between untrusting parties while preserving user privacy.
