abstract: <jats:sec> <jats:title>Background</jats:title> <jats:p>Consumer electronics
  or daily use home appliances are the basic necessity of every household. With the
  adoption of IoT in consumer electronics, this industry is set to rise exponentially.
  In recent times, the demand for consumer electronics rises amidst the pandemic due
  to a paradigm shift from in-office culture to work from home. Despite intelligent
  IoT devices, smart home configuration, and appliances at our disposal, the rudimentary
  client-server architecture fails to provide facilities like full access control
  of data and devices, transparency, secured communication, and synchronization between
  multiple devices, etc. to the users.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
  <jats:p>To overcome these limitations, Blockchain technology has been adopted in
  recent years, however, it has its own set of limitations in its widespread implementation.
  Hence, we propose a methodology using the IOTA platform, a distributed ledger technology
  (DLT) for secured communication between consumer electronics devices and appliances.</jats:p>
  </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>The implementation
  provides access control, interoperability, data storage, and management with an
  exploratory insight towards a decentralized micro-payment use-case between Electric
  cars and charging stations.</jats:p> </jats:sec>
