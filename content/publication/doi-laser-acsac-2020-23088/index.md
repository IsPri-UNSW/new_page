abstract: Following the recent Internet of Things-induced trends on digitization in
  general, industrial applications will further evolve as well. With a focus on the
  domains of manufacturing and production, the Internet of Production pursues the
  vision of a digitized, globally interconnected, yet secure environment by establishing
  a distributed knowledge base. Background. As part of our collaborative research
  of advancing the scope of industrial applications through cybersecurity and privacy,
  we identified a set of common challenges and pitfalls that surface in such applied
  interdisciplinary collaborations. Aim. Our goal with this paper is to support researchers
  in the emerging field of cybersecurity in industrial settings by formalizing our
  experiences as reference for other research efforts, in industry and academia alike.
  Method. Based on our experience, we derived a process cycle of performing such interdisciplinary
  research, from the initial idea to the eventual dissemination and paper writing.
  This presented methodology strives to successfully bootstrap further research and
  to encourage further work in this emerging area. Results. Apart from our newly proposed
  process cycle, we report on our experiences and conduct a case study applying this
  methodology, raising awareness for challenges in cybersecurity research for industrial
  applications. We further detail the interplay between our process cycle and the
  data lifecycle in applied research data management. Finally, we augment our discussion
  with an industrial as well as an academic view on this research area and highlight
  that both areas still have to overcome significant challenges to sustainably and
  securely advance industrial applications. Conclusions. With our proposed process
  cycle for interdisciplinary research in the intersection of cybersecurity and industrial
  application, we provide a foundation for further research. We look forward to promising
  research initiatives, projects, and directions that emerge based on our methodological
  work.
